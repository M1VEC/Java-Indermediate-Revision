# Java-Revision
This repository is a program I am writing whilst learning Java through 'Code with Mosh'
I've decided to do it this way while I am following the coursework as it is more time coding, opportunities to 
implement what I'm learning and by the end of it I will have a revision program that I can quickly use to help me refresh the information
I have learnt.
